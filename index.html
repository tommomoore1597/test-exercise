      <!--
      Welcome to your Be a Developer at Primate Exercise.
      
      Please fork this project so you can work on your own version.
      ---
      
      This exercise will give you an idea of the type of work we do at Primate on a daily basis.

      The exercise consists of two tasks:
      1. Building the Card component (HTML and CSS).
      2. and connecting them with the presented graphical element
      
      The attached iframe is a reference to a mock-up of how the cards should look like and here's a link to Figma file where you can get more details:
      https://www.figma.com/file/zEJBOBhuFQmJKEX0jHXrur/Primate-dev-exercise?node-id=1%3A307 

      The list should:
      - allow for different length of the text
      - and different colour of connecting elements 

      You should be able to achieve it using flexbox and grid but we're open to other ideas.

      This is the element we recently build ourselves for one of the websites we are working on and it was quite fun to watch how different people tried to approach it differently.
      Some solutions are better than others. Although we provide design assets in original Figma file but we think it is better to build everything with HTML and CSS only.

      The font we're using is Quicksand (@import link in the CSS file)

      Spend as much time on it as you wish, but we don't expect you to take more than 2h. Most likely you won't have time to do everything in this timeframe, that's absolutely OK too. 

      If you want to leave us some comments about this task, explain your decisions, tell us what you enjoyed or hated, please use the HTML comments in one of the files.

      As final submission, please email a link to your own project fork to jobs@primate.co.uk and include your name somewhere.

      Thank you again for taking time to do this exercise, we really appreciate it.

      ---
      Good luck and ...
      ~ happy coding

      P.S. We've noticed that some browsers have issues running stackblitz but Chrome seems to deal with it best. You will have to fork the project to see everything correctly.
  
      P.P.S Don't worry if you can't get it working within the timeframe. It's not an easy task and requires some CSS creativity. We want to see how you would approach it and what you attempted to do.
